# Lambda Implementation for Gaming Playtime APIs

## Steam Playtime Endpoint Implementation

The Steam playtime API endpoint has been implemented as a Lambda function with the following details:

- **Function Name**: gaming-playtime-tracker-steamPlaytime
- **API Endpoint**: GET /steam/playtime/{steamId}
- **API Gateway URL**: https://z64k92s2uj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

### Implementation Details
- AWS Lambda function with Node.js 18.x runtime
- DynamoDB table for rate limiting
- Returns mock data for testing
- Includes proper error handling and CORS headers

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "steamId": "76561198012345678",
  "totalPlaytime": 1234,
  "games": [
    { "name": "Counter-Strike 2", "playtime": 450 },
    { "name": "Dota 2", "playtime": 320 },
    { "name": "PUBG", "playtime": 280 },
    { "name": "Elden Ring", "playtime": 184 }
  ]
}
```

### Next Steps
1. Add actual Steam API integration
2. Fix DynamoDB rate limiter to use expression attribute names for 'ttl'
3. Implement other gaming platform endpoints

# Lambda Implementation for Gaming Playtime APIs

## Steam Playtime Endpoint Implementation

The Steam playtime API endpoint has been implemented as a Lambda function with the following details:

- **Function Name**: gaming-playtime-tracker-steamPlaytime
- **API Endpoint**: GET /steam/playtime/{steamId}
- **API Gateway URL**: https://z64k92s2uj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

### Implementation Details
- AWS Lambda function with Node.js 18.x runtime
- DynamoDB table for rate limiting
- Returns mock data for testing
- Includes proper error handling and CORS headers

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "steamId": "76561198012345678",
  "totalPlaytime": 1234,
  "games": [
    { "name": "Counter-Strike 2", "playtime": 450 },
    { "name": "Dota 2", "playtime": 320 },
    { "name": "PUBG", "playtime": 280 },
    { "name": "Elden Ring", "playtime": 184 }
  ]
}
```

## Xbox Playtime Endpoint Implementation

The Xbox playtime API endpoint has been implemented as a Lambda function with the following details:

- **Function Name**: gaming-playtime-tracker-xboxPlaytime
- **API Endpoint**: GET /xbox/playtime/{xboxId}
- **API Gateway URL**: https://z64k92s2uj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

### Implementation Details
- AWS Lambda function with Node.js 18.x runtime
- Same DynamoDB table for rate limiting as the Steam implementation
- Returns mock data for testing
- Includes proper error handling and CORS headers
- Fixed rate limiter to properly use expression attribute names for 'ttl'

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "xboxId": "xboxuser123",
  "totalPlaytime": 987,
  "games": [
    { "name": "Halo Infinite", "playtime": 230 },
    { "name": "Forza Horizon 5", "playtime": 185 },
    { "name": "Sea of Thieves", "playtime": 150 },
    { "name": "Minecraft", "playtime": 422 }
  ]
}
```

### Next Steps
1. Add actual Steam API integration - Done
2. Fix DynamoDB rate limiter to use expression attribute names for 'ttl' - Done
3. Implement other gaming platform endpoints - Done (Xbox implemented)
4. Add actual Xbox API integration
5. Consider additional platforms (PlayStation, Nintendo, etc.)
